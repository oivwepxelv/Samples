# Samples (an A/B test example)

## Filler data
Please note that generate_filler_data.py is a CLI used to create the random data in filler_facebook_ad_data.csv (run_generate_filler_data.sh contains the last-used inputs that were used to create the current version of filler_facebook_ad_data.csv). The data in filler_facebook_ad_data.csv is designed to look exactly like a real dataset that would be exported from Facebook Ads manager, with just the most fundamental available breakdowns.

## Analysis
The Jupyter notebook split_test_analysis.ipynb contains a sample preliminary summary of the A/B test data in filler_facebook_ad_data.csv. The contents have been exported to split_test_analysis.html for ease of viewing.
