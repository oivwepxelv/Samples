## Filler data
### Please note that generate_filler_data.py is a CLI used to create filler_facebook_ad_data.csv (run_generate_filler_data.sh contains the last-used inputs that were used to create the current version of filler_facebook_ad_data.csv). The data in filler_facebook_ad_data.csv is designed to look like a very simple version of real data, exported from Facebook Ads manager, that I have worked with in the past.

## Analysis
### The Jupyter notebook split_test_analysis.ipynb contains a sample analysis similar to some A/B test analysis I have submitted in past projects. The contents have been exported to split_test_analysis.html for easy viewing.
